# Demo: Nodal Search Algorithms
Examples of nodal search algorithms based of my University tutorial work for the module "Artificial Intelligence for Game Developers". Currently implemented at; Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and Dijkstra's Algorithm. Project is currently setup for use with C++ compiler v141 on Microsoft Visual Studio 2017.
